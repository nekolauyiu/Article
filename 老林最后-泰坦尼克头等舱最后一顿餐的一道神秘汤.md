泰坦尼克头等舱最后一顿餐的一道神秘汤

Olga清汤。厨师菜谱、做法还留存，能复制，可是似乎没人知道这道汤的确切来源；有人认为可能是一个叫Olga的俄罗斯女性教某个厨师而流传下来的不为人知汤方。 [/cp]

“After dessert, the stewards offered coffee, which in France had been a standard after-dinner beverage since about 1860. On board the Titanic, coffee was probably made by a drip process, although the much stronger Turkish coffee may well have been available in first class. Either way, coffee was typically accompanied by cigars, Port , and liqueurs, then called “cordials”. Often the liqueur was poured straight into the coffee, which meant the cups were served only three-quarters full.”
